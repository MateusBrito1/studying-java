# Studying Java for 100Days 🐱‍🏍

<p>[1 - day] - I learned about Java's 'forEach' loop, 'for' loops, and conditionals today. My familiarity with other programming languages ​​made it easier for me to understand these concepts.</p>
<p>[2 - day] - Today, I had the opportunity to explore methods in Java. Although I didn't dedicate a long period of time to studying, I was able to apply the knowledge I gained by doing some bootcamp exercises. </p>
<p>[3 - day] - Today I gave a feel for methods and made some important notes for future reference. I also reviewed getters and setters for a little refresher. At the end of the night, I completed a bootcamp assignment.</p>
